# DIY Cable for AKG K702

<p>Using Bispa's <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/3283107253844806817#">wire (BSP-NXOFC-104QCL)</a>, I made a cable for <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/3283107253844806817#">AKG K702</a>. I will write about the method and changes in sound.</p>
<h2 id="h9707d3a59a">Overview</h2>
<p>I purchased AKG K702 at the end of August. It is an open-back headphone that supports recabling and can be obtained for 15,000 yen, with excellent band balance and high resolution relative to its price. It may be challenging in environments with insufficient power, such as direct insertion into a smartphone, but if you have an amplifier that can drive it, I think it's a high cost-performance headphone.</p>
<p>Since I was able to obtain it cheaply, I wanted to try upgrading it further with an inexpensive cable, so I made one.</p>
<h2 id="h59c0294b52">Materials</h2>
<p>All wires and connectors can be obtained from Bispa.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Total: <strong>5,480</strong> yen</p>
<p>The wire is unplated OFC. It's a simple wire, but with annealing treatment and the use of XLPE with a low relative dielectric constant, I think it's quite luxurious compared to the stock cable. The MINI XLR uses beryllium copper, and the stereo plug supports both 3.5mm and standard sizes.</p>
<p>I used solder such as Wako Technical's SR-4NCu. I wanted to enhance the bass of K702 a bit and make the sound warmer. If only SR-4NCu is used, male vocals might feel a bit lacking, so I used other solders as well, assigning one type each to the MINI XLR and stereo plug.</p>
<p>When using solder sold by Bispa with the above materials, avoid Kester, DUTCH BOY, Kirkson, and Cardas. Depending on your preference for high frequencies, as long as you avoid silver (Ag)-containing solder, anything should be fine. Since this wire provides solid high frequencies, silver-containing solder might have hit-or-miss results.</p>
<h2 id="h9299695b4e">DIY Process</h2>
<p>The wire comes pre-twisted when purchased. As long as you're not increasing the number of cores, you can just strip the insulation and proceed with soldering the plugs.</p>
<p>The Mini XLR has the following configuration.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The connectors are properly numbered, so please check the actual item. The pin assignment is: Pin 1 for GND, Pin 2 for Right, Pin 3 for Left. Since the cable has 4 cores, assign 2 cores to Pin 1, and 1 core each to the rest, then solder them.</p>
<p>For the stereo mini plug, it is assigned as Left, Right, and GND from the tip. Use a tester or similar to confirm the pin configuration of your stereo mini plug, and solder each channel and GND to correspond with the Mini XLR's pin assignment.</p>

<h2 id="habecbf1f8d">Review</h2>
<p>Compared to the stock cable, the sound becomes denser while remaining light with fine grain. This is especially evident in the mid to high frequencies, enhancing the extension of high frequencies and the delicate sound inherent in K702. The bass, being K702, doesn't become overly heavy, but it gains more weight and presence, resulting in a somewhat harder sound.</p>
<p>The stock cable feels lighter and more balanced, but it seems to lack resolution, localization, and range.</p>
<h2 id="h9710ffdf15">Aside</h2>
<p>Each has its pros and cons, but since you can try stock cables or DIY cables for around 5,000 yen, it's good to experiment with various options. Since it uses a 3-pin Mini XLR, converting to balanced would require modifying the headphones themselves. This means it won't be as casual for recabling, so please be cautious.</p>
<h2 id="ha214098e44">Summary</h2>
<p>Compared to other headphones, K702 has more potential for improvement through recabling, and it's attractive because you can try it inexpensively and easily. I hope this serves as an opportunity for you to enjoy recabling in various configurations.
