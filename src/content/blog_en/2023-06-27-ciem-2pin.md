<p>Introducing four points to use 2Pin type IEMs for a long time.</p><h2 id="h9e2a206709">Tragedy Strikes Suddenly</h2><p>I purchased the JH13Pro almost four years ago and have handled it with great care.<br>The excitement I felt when I first listened to it is still vivid in my memory, and even as new IEMs continue to emerge,<br>I have stuck with it. Whether commuting by train, at home, or developing DIY audio accessories,<br>it has become an integral part of my life.<br><br>At the time, with the metal faceplate option, it cost around ¥156,000;<br>now, without options, it's ¥177,800, and delivery takes over three months.<br>The thought of any breakdown is unthinkable due to the high cost and time involved.<br>However, tragedy can strike suddenly...</p><blockquote><p>JH13Pro socket pin bent. I messed up. <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/qkrgX2vBvr">pic.twitter.com/qkrgX2vBvr<br><br>—</a> Siba (@iRslog) <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/3810974693333913871?hl=ja#">October 28, 2014</a></p></blockquote><p>While taking the earphones out of the pouch during a train commute, I noticed that the pin on the left side of the IEM was bent.<br>When I tried to fix it, one pin snapped off completely. As I attempted to pull it out, the other one also broke.<br>The pins ended up stuck in the socket and couldn't be removed.<br><br>Repair costs exceed ¥20,000, and as mentioned, it takes a significant amount of time.<br>Why did this accident happen?</p><h2 id="h8965896b6c">Situation Before the Accident</h2><p>As shown in the photo, the IEM is a flat-type 2Pin model. The pins are JH style, which is the standard 0.78mm type for 2Pin connectors.<br>The quality of the connector itself is fine for normal use.<br>For carrying the cable, I used a semi-hard fabric pouch from UM, which has some flexibility.<br><br>This is my fourth cable; starting from the second one, I've used self-made ones, and up until the fourth, I reused the 2Pin connectors.<br>I've bent the pins more than 45 degrees about twice before, but I straightened them and continued using them.<br>During this pin breakage incident, I applied a third load, which led to the accident.</p><h2 id="hd12d4186da">Points to Prevent Accidents</h2><p>Unlike MMCX pins, CIEM pins are fragile and basically break due to metal fatigue from excessive stress.<br>It's safe to assume that for flat-type connectors, extra caution is needed as they are prone to stress.<br><br>In my case, the fact that it survived two bends, along with being able to reuse and repair them myself through DIY,<br>led to a complacent attitude of thinking I could just fix it if it broke.<br>As a result, I didn't pay attention to the risks and ended up with serious damage.<br>To avoid such unnecessary risks, it's wise to keep the following points in mind.<br><br><strong>1. If a pin is bent more than 45 degrees, do not use that cable</strong><br><strong>2. Avoid soft cases and ensure stress-free transportation</strong><br><strong>3. Avoid unnecessary plugging and unplugging of cables</strong><br><strong>4. Order with embedded connectors</strong><br><br>Point 1 is a direct cause of metal fatigue. You can't use it while bent, so straightening it might seem like a solution, but that adds to the fatigue.<br>This increases the risk of pin breakage, so it's cheaper and safer to replace the cable or swap the connector.<br><br>Point 2 addresses transportation issues. Using soft materials can transfer stress to the connector during transit.<br>Even with rigid cases, if things move around loosely, the same problem can occur.<br>Since the connector protrudes from the CIEM, external pressure can easily affect it.<br>Therefore, a sturdy case that minimizes such risks is ideal for transportation.<br><br>Point 3 is about avoiding unnecessary plugging and unplugging. With a 0.78mm socket and 0.78mm connector,<br>strong friction occurs, wearing down both the pins and socket during insertion and removal.<br>This wear can loosen the cable's fit and risk deforming the pins, so avoid unplugging unless necessary.<br>Additionally, some connectors are thicker than 0.78mm or are 0.75mm types, which may not fit properly.<br>Using mismatched sizes can cause wear or pin breakage. If you feel any discomfort when attaching a cable, it's best not to use it.<br><br>Point 4 involves embedded connectors, where part of the connector is embedded into the shell to reduce stress on the pins.<br>This might limit cable options, which some people dislike, but recently, many recabling products support embedded connectors.<br>If you're aiming for the best sound quality, options like UM, Rooth, 1964, Assembly Lab, Westone, and Canal Works' new models support embedded 2Pin,<br>so choosing embedded is a good idea if durability is a priority.<br><br>Some manufacturers don't offer embedded options. If you already have a flat-type, you'll have to invest time and money to change it.<br>However, just following the first three points can greatly reduce the risk of pin breakage. Metal fatigue is mostly due to user handling and environment,<br>so if any of this sounds familiar, I recommend taking precautions against risks.<br><br>Also, if you're considering purchasing a 2Pin type IEM in the future, please keep these four points in mind<br>to enjoy it for a long time. I hope fewer people make the same mistake.</p>
