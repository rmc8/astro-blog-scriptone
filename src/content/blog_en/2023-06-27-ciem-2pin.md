# 4 Points to Avoid Pin Bending in CIEM 2Pin

<p>Here are four points to help you use 2Pin type IEMs for a long time.</p><h2 id="h9e2a206709">Tragedy Strikes Suddenly</h2><p>I purchased the JH13Pro and have been using it carefully for almost four years. The excitement I felt when I first listened to it is still vivid in my memory, and even as new IEMs keep emerging, I've continued to use it with dedication. Whether commuting by train, at home, or developing custom audio accessories, it's become an integral part of my life.

At the time, with the metal faceplate option, it cost around ¥156,000; now, without options, it's ¥177,800, and delivery takes over three months. The price and time involved make you want to avoid any breakdowns at all costs. However, tragedy can strike suddenly...</p><blockquote><p>JH13Pro socket pin bent. I messed up. <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/qkrgX2vBvr">pic.twitter.com/qkrgX2vBvr</a><br><br>— Siba (@iRslog) <a href="https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/3810974693333913871?hl=ja#">October 28, 2014</a></p></blockquote><p>While taking the earphones out of the pouch during a train commute, I noticed that the pin on the left side of the IEM was bent. When I tried to fix it, one pin snapped off completely. As I attempted to pull it out, the other one broke as well. The pins were now stuck firmly in the socket and couldn't be removed.

Repair costs would exceed ¥20,000, and as mentioned, it would take a significant amount of time. Why did this accident happen?</p><h2 id="h8965896b6c">Situation Before the Accident</h2><p>As shown in the photo, the IEM is a flat-type 2Pin IEM. The pins are the standard 0.78mm type for JH 2Pin connectors. The connector quality is fine for normal use. For carrying the cable, I used a semi-hard fabric pouch from UM, which has some flexibility.

This is my fourth cable; starting from the second one, I've been using self-made ones, and up until the fourth, I reused the 2Pin connectors. I've bent the pins more than 45 degrees about twice before, but I straightened them and continued using them. The third instance of stress on the pins during this accident led to the breakage.</p><h2 id="hd12d4186da">Points to Prevent Accidents</h2><p>Like MMCX pins, CIEM pins are fragile and typically break due to metal fatigue from excessive stress. For flat-type connectors, they are especially prone to stress, so extra caution is needed.

In my case, the fact that it survived two bends, along with being able to reuse and repair them myself through custom work, led to a sense of complacency—like thinking I could just fix it if it broke. As a result, I didn't pay attention to the risks and ended up with serious damage. To avoid such unnecessary risks, it's worth keeping the following points in mind:

<strong>1. If you bend a pin more than 45 degrees, do not use that cable</strong><br><strong>2. Avoid soft cases and ensure stress-free transportation</strong><br><strong>3. Avoid unnecessary plugging and unplugging of cables</strong><br><strong>4. Order with embedded connectors</strong><br>

Point 1 is a direct cause of metal fatigue. You can't use it while bent, so you'll try to straighten it, but that itself adds to the fatigue. This increases the risk of pin breakage, so it's cheaper and safer to replace the cable or swap the connector.

Point 2 addresses transportation issues. Using soft materials can transfer stress to the connector during transport. Even with rigid cases, if things move around loosely, the same problem can occur. Since the connector protrudes from the CIEM, external pressure can easily affect it. A sturdy case that minimizes such risks is ideal for transportation.

Point 3 is about avoiding unnecessary plugging and unplugging. The 0.78mm socket and 0.78mm connector create friction, which stresses both the pin and socket during insertion and removal, leading to wear. Worn connectors can loosen the cable's hold and risk deforming the pins. So, avoid plugging and unplugging unless necessary. Also, in some cases, connectors might be slightly thicker than 0.78mm or as small as 0.75mm, which don't fit properly and can cause wear or breakage. If you feel any discomfort when attaching a cable, it's best not to use it.

Point 4 involves embedded connectors, where part of the connector is embedded into the shell to reduce stress on the pins. This might limit recabling options, and some people dislike it, but recently, many recabling products support embedded connectors. If you're prioritizing sound quality, options like UM, Rooth, 1964, Kumitate Lab, Westone, and Canal Works' new models support embedded 2Pin, so it's worth considering for durability.

Not all manufacturers offer embedded options. If you've already bought a flat-type, you'll have to invest time and money to change it. However, just following the first three points can greatly reduce the risk of pin breakage. Metal fatigue is mostly due to user handling and environment, so if any of this sounds familiar, take steps to mitigate the risks.

For those considering purchasing a 2Pin type IEM in the future, please keep these four points in mind so you can enjoy it for a long time. I hope fewer people experience this mishap.
