## Overview

I ordered the [SALONIA Pure Bright Steamer](https://amzn.to/4mz2i7O) on 2024-10-18 and have been using it almost daily since it arrived. From a moisturizing perspective alone, it achieves the goal more efficiently and affordably than using expensive toners, and I personally find it very cost-effective. Therefore, I switched my skincare set from department store brands to more affordable ones. During sales, the Pure Bright Steamer can be purchased for under 20,000 yen, and despite its price range, the toner mist function is a key selling point. However, I have completely stopped using the toner mist. Today, I would like to touch on this matter.

## About the Toner Mist Function

The toner mist is often featured as a flagship function in high-end facial steamers. Originally, facial steamers did not come with a toner mist function, but it was introduced with Panasonic's [EH-SA0B](https://amzn.to/4kwbub3), released on November 1, 2020. After warming the skin with the steamer and allowing purified water to penetrate, the toner mist, which is finely atomized and sprayed, can deliver 15% more moisturizing ingredients into the stratum corneum compared to applying by hand (Source: <https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000003933.000003442.html>).

In the case of SALONIA's Pure Bright Steamer, it sprays toner mist with particles about 90 µm in size, smaller than the average pore diameter of about 400 µm, allowing the toner to penetrate more efficiently than applying it by hand. This is a major selling point of the steamer. While basic steamers can be purchased for as little as a few hundred yen, those with a toner mist function typically start at around 20,000 yen (Source: <https://salonia.jp/special/steamer/?srsltid=AfmBOoqiTlR8_TLwAd0d11oiPpwun2sz42Pg3jv9nGQB7o9FfaaRmd6a＠>).

## Reasons for Stopping the Use of Toner Mist

Reading up to this point, the toner mist may seem like an excellent feature. Indeed, it allows the toner to be absorbed quickly, and you can feel the cooling sensation on the skin from the absorbed toner, which indicates a tangible benefit. However, I stopped using the toner mist for the following reasons:

1. Extremely high toner consumption
2. Only one use worth of toner can be inserted, requiring the toner bottle to be washed each time
3. Many affordable alternatives are available

### Extremely High Toner Consumption

With the SALONIA Pure Bright Steamer, it consumes 7 mL of toner at once. When applying toner by hand, a common instruction is to use an amount the size of a 500-yen coin, which is about 1-2 mL. Assuming 2 mL is used per application, the steamer's toner mist function consumes 3.5 times that amount. While adjusting the quantity could be a solution, the SALONIA Pure Bright Steamer does not have measurement markings on the toner bottle or water tank, so despite its high cost, its usability raises some questions.

### Only One Use Worth of Toner Can Be Inserted, Requiring the Toner Bottle to Be Washed Each Time

For me personally, the decisive factor was the need to wash the bottle after each use. The high consumption and the hassle of adjusting the amount already detract from the user experience, but on top of that, the need to rinse and dry the bottle after use to keep it clean and hygienic feels extremely cumbersome. Moisturizing with purified water is inexpensive and highly effective, so I can accept the hassle of washing and drying the bottle for that purpose. However, doing the same for the toner mist feels overly burdensome. I couldn't tolerate the toner consumption, the hassle of adjusting the amount, or the cleaning process, so I gave up on using the toner mist. I believe this is not just an issue with SALONIA's Pure Bright Steamer but a general problem with facial steamers equipped with toner mist functions currently on the market.

### Many Affordable Alternatives Are Available

I have confirmed that facial steamers with toner mist functions are expensive and require significant effort. While affordable facial steamers do not have equivalent features, there are various alternatives outside the realm of facial steamers. Standalone steamers specialized in misting toner can be found for around 1,000 yen, trigger-type spray bottles for less than 1,000 yen, and air spray types that mist toner more finely (20 µm) for about 7,000 yen. If you're not fixated on the toner mist function, there are steamers with strong steaming capabilities or more affordable options available. On the other hand, there are also many affordable alternatives for simply misting toner, making it hard to justify choosing a facial steamer with a toner mist function.

## About the Alternative I Currently Use

I stopped using the toner mist function of the SALONIA Pure Bright Steamer, but instead, I use a spray bottle. Specifically, I use Nitori's [Micro Mist Spray (250mL White)](https://www.nitori-net.jp/ec/product/8501198s/). The particle size of the mist for this Nitori product is not officially stated, so it is unknown, but many similar products have a mist size of about 200 µm. Generally, this is smaller than the pore size of 400 µm, and even at around 200 µm, it is sufficiently smaller than the pore size. Additionally, in terms of actual usage, I can feel the skin cooling as it absorbs the toner, so I believe it functions similarly to the toner mist of a facial steamer.

Moreover, the Micro Mist Spray is a trigger type, allowing delicate control of the amount by adjusting the force used to pull the trigger. Even pulling it fully, it sprays for about 3 seconds before stopping, so there is no worry of dispensing as much as 7 mL at once. The bottle can hold 250 mL of toner, and there is no need to clean it after use. It is very convenient as I can spray it directly onto my face without getting toner on my hands. Priced at just 699 yen, it is extremely affordable, and I find the ease of use and experience of the Micro Mist Spray to be far more cost-effective compared to the toner mist, which is why I stopped using the toner mist function of the Pure Bright Steamer.

For those who are particular, there is [LINKA](https://amzn.to/44ViE4m), and there are also more convenient [portable mists](https://amzn.to/3ZpiNtl). Alternatively, some toner bottles themselves come in spray form, allowing effective misting just by purchasing the toner. Considering this, buying an expensive facial steamer just for the toner mist function feels like a weak motivation, and I am inclined to consider models with powerful steam functions or more affordable options (I am very satisfied with the substantial hydration provided by purified water and such).

## Conclusion

Facial steamers- Facial steamers can provide moisture to the skin more affordably than expensive toners. On the other hand, regarding the efficient penetration of toner, there are many options besides the toner mist of facial steamers, and I mentioned that facial steamers with toner mist functions may seem convenient but are surprisingly inconvenient. For the time being, I won't be purchasing facial steamers with toner mist functions, and I think it would be good to efficiently spray just the necessary amount using options like spray bottles or air sprays. There are many areas for improvement in the toner mist function of facial steamers, and if facial steamers can provide the same experience as alternatives with just one device, it would reduce hassle and make the effects of facial steamers more tangible. While there aren't many types of facial steamers with toner mist functions, I have experienced the powerful hydration provided by facial steamers, so I look forward to opportunities for enhanced experiences and further improvements.
