# Topping PA5 II Sound Quality Review

I purchased the Topping [PA5 II](https://www.toppingaudio.com/product-item/pa5-ii-pa5-iiplus) from Amazon (sold by Shenzhen Audio). The purchase price was 33,700 yen. Here's a simple review.

## About TOPPING

TOPPING is an audio brand established in Guangzhou, China, in 2008. It offers a wide range of products, including DACs for desktops, headphone amplifiers, and amplifiers for speakers. Its philosophy is "TOPPING, bringing sincerity to music, bringing beauty to the world." It provides products that are compact, affordable, and high-performing. While not sold in major electronics stores, it is highly regarded as a reliable Chinese audio brand available on Amazon and elsewhere.

## About PA5 II

PA5 II is the latest power amplifier succeeding the PA5. It is a Class D amplifier that supports full balance. With a DC 38V/3.0A power supply, it delivers sufficient output for its compact size, providing clear sound quality that exceeds expectations. The pop noise during power-on has been completely eliminated, making it easy to use compared to other power amplifiers in the same price range. The PA5 II Plus features a DC 38V/4.0A power supply, making it ideal for applications requiring more power.

The front panel includes a power switch, a switch for single-ended and balanced output, and a volume control. The rear panel has the power input, speaker output terminals (compatible with banana plugs), RCA input (single-ended), and TRS input (balanced). Note that the balanced input uses TRS instead of XLR, so be cautious when setting up your environment.

The size is 12.9cm (width) x 16.6cm (depth) x 4.1cm (height), making it very compact compared to other power amplifiers in the same price range, with a weight of 680 grams.

## Reasons for Purchase

I am using FiiO's K7 as a sub-system. This device, which is about the same size as the PA5 II, includes a USB DAC and headphone amplifier. By adding the PA5 II, I can also drive speakers. Among options in the same price range, Topping stood out for its compact size, sufficient reliability, and track record. While there are domestic manufacturers like Sony, Yamaha, and DENON, their products often come with unnecessary features or non-customizable power configurations, so I was drawn to the PA5 II for its balanced size, price, and ability to build a simple sub-system.

## Review

The setup is as follows:

| Equipment | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Player | iPad mini + Amazon Music (using AirPlay) |
| Transporter | Raspberry Pi 3 + moOde Audio |
| DAC | FiiO K7 |
| RCA | Belden 88760 |
| Amplifier | Topping PA5 II |

| Speaker | ACOUSTIC ENERGY REFERENCE 1 |
| Wall Outlet | FURUTECH GTX-D NCF(R) |

Since the K7's line output is RCA and only single-ended, this review is based on single-ended use. For a compact and affordable fully balanced setup, combining it with the same brand's [e50](https://www.amazon.co.jp/TOPPING-E50-ES9068AS-768kHz-DSD512/dp/B09F29QCVW?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.v_xkxGqhRDnio4mM47ohyNPnrFJeT4DWVfn40XRwaSNHnEHCaHyuq8VPD5d1IywWWUbkDSN71h7GhTuORYEPdcovpwY5VcBaKdniJaYrpX4xZJGSeWvoTKVwqXUxQhBiyN4k_MaMtdvqPmw2bHQf_BELdXz7KK8Kdt5oivwF0OjWezPZ3DX8tJ2oLYc068e21SH1wVsknkuMHRt_qsWsWy8h8cN95KiBvdG2f_gu3soRTAvqF54nfg7bNc6MSBGdB8lq5VeeUsQ0YE-Rjc3CDHnkmT6VUl9g8re3c-crEWc.xY89OvZOW6qz7n_gRSxQVALNhIWhNcBRCeZn76Q-PNA&dib_tag=se&keywords=Topping+e50&qid=1722600710&sr=8-1&linkCode=ll1&tag=rmc-8-22&linkId=3151a220544adc351403176a79652ce7&language=ja_JP&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) would be a good option.

The overall sound tendency is flat and neutral. The highs are neither hard nor soft, with no edge, and they sound cleanly without any issues. While the range doesn't feel particularly wide or extended, the lack of quirks makes it reliable for background music and suitable for long-term use.

The midrange has a slight softness, making it more suitable for female vocals than male. Male vocals may feel a bit high in the waist, so they might feel lacking for POP, rock, or metal. On the other hand, it pairs well with female vocals, jazz, classical, or acoustic sources.

The bass also has a slight softness but with a quick speed, so it feels adequate for tracks where bass is not the main focus or for those without strong bass preferences.

However, given its price range of around 30,000 yen, there are limits to sound silence and drive power. It doesn't fully drive bookshelf-type speakers. It's more suited for small speakers or 1-way/2-way setups in compact environments. For more power, consider combining with PA5 II Plus or e50 for a fully balanced setup.

Additionally, the chassis has vents on the sides and bottom for heat dissipation, and as a Class D amplifier, it tends to generate more heat. After several hours of use, the entire chassis gets warm, but it doesn't become untouchable, so it's not necessary to be overly concerned.

Overall, it's a user-friendly amplifier with no pop noise or gang errors, producing clean sound from its compact size.

## Future System Building

For compact playback, I feel the current speakers might be a bit excessive. I'd like to try with a smaller 1-way speaker enclosure like the BS-8 and track the sound changes.

## Summary

I purchased and tested the Topping PA5 II, a staple in Chinese audio. It offers a neutral, flat sound and a compact design, providing stability that's reassuring for audio beginners. While it's neutral, it doesn't lose the sound's color or force high resolution or Hi-Fi feel; it's a straightforward, good choice in its price range.
