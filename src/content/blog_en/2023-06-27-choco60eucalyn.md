<p>I added the Eucalyn layout to the assembled Choco60 and mastered touch typing.<br><br></p><h2 id="h4acfd61247">Acquisition Period and Results</h2><p><br><br>In conclusion, after 17 days of practice, I became able to touch type with the Eucalyn layout at a speed of 3.4 keys/sec. Converting to WPM, that's 204 WPM, which is sufficient for general office work. I'll share the reasons for choosing the Eucalyn layout, practice methods, and progress.<br><br></p><h2 id="h3b03bf2335">Encounter with Eucalyn Layout (and Custom Keyboards)</h2><p><br><br>It's what people call the 'Google cannon,' but I enjoy browsing news on Chrome as usual, and that's when I came across a story about someone who injured their finger badly and couldn't use the keyboard anymore. Out of curiosity, I started researching if there are keyboard layouts for one-handed typing.<br><br>At first, it was just curiosity, but I learned about a stylish custom keyboard called Helix, which comes with a one-handed input layout called <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">Floggy</a>.<br><br>I was already aware of the existence of custom keyboards (hereinafter, self-keyboards) from news about Yushako Workshop opening or tweets about self-keyboards, but I realized in June last month that the community is very passionate, with people focusing on and evolving layouts. Motivated by that passion, I researched various layouts and found the following article.</p><ul><li><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">Key Layout Showdown! Which is the Strongest Layout?</a></li></ul><p><br>The Eucalyn layout I found there maintains QWERTY shortcuts while offering an arrangement easy for arpeggio keystrokes like Dvorak, making it suitable for Japanese and programming in Python, which piqued my interest. I've learned Dvorak and thumb shift before, but Dvorak has scattered shortcuts that make it inconvenient, and thumb shift is hard to type quickly, so I haven't used them. Since then, I've stuck with QWERTY as my main layout, putting up with its discomfort.<br><br>After injuring my back in a traffic accident or at work and wanting a split keyboard, I purchased and assembled <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">Choco60</a>, and decided to flash the Eucalyn layout onto it.<br><br></p><h2 id="h631ac9e414">Eucalyn Layout for Choco60</h2><p><br><br>I uploaded the JSON file for the Eucalyn layout for Choco60 to <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">Google Drive</a>. You can load this into QMK Configurator to check or edit the layout. Pressing <code>Fn key + Left space key</code> switches to the Eucalyn layout, and <code>Fn key + Right space key</code> switches back to QWERTY. Note that I've personally set the BS key as the Del key.<br><br>If you want to flash it without any changes under these conditions, you can directly download the <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">hex</a> file and flash it.<br><br>However, instead of the Eucalyn layout mentioned in the Yushako Workshop article, I chose to use the <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">newer 2018 version of Eucalyn</a>. The old layout has lower costs for writing Python, but I preferred the new one for its compatibility with QWERTY without much difference in cost.<br><br></p><h2 id="h3e80ab0087">Sites for Practicing Eucalyn</h2><p><br><br>I'll introduce two practice sites and one Eucalyn experience site.<br><br></p><h3 id="h76f284b66f">Sushi Hit</h3><ul><li><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/7741051522068879882?hl=ja#">Sushi Hit (Practice / Easy Course)</a><ul><li>Once you learn touch typing, it's good to eat sushi as the main focus.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="h7909427d8d">myTyping</h3><p><br><br>During practice, if the QWERTY layout is displayed, it might cause confusion, so I practice with the layout hidden.

Up to 'ta' row, it can be done entirely on the middle row of the keyboard, so I ingrained the image there, and then learned the remaining consonants for the right hand. For the left hand, since the changes from QWERTY are low outside the middle row, I didn't take special measures.<br><br>After about 2 hours of this practice, I memorized the layout in my head and could start typing on Sushi Hit's easy course, so I gradually practiced finger movements on Sushi Hit while repeatedly reinforcing the layout on myTyping to smoothly type the Japanese syllabary.<br><br></p><h2 id="hcf056f23d0">Practice Process and Speed Progression</h2><p>The tweets below show the practice status from the start up to the 17th day.

'pervert' level), but compared to that, it's still a bit awkward speed-wise. Since there are speed differences between the two layouts, it feels unfamiliar, but like Dvorak, the arpeggio keystrokes are easy, and the rhythmic typing with right and left hands is very enjoyable.<br><br>Additionally, because it has compatibility with QWERTY shortcuts, I can perform familiar operations like copy-paste or closing tabs. For example, when searching emails in Outlook with <code>ctrl + e</code>, I might accidentally use QWERTY habits, or when trying to type quickly, the two layouts might mix, which is a common issue. Even so, for Japanese syllabary, with a little practice, Eucalyn is faster, so I see the long-term benefits of continuing to use it.</p><h2 id="hf7f776bda9">Points of Concern</h2><p>Although it's become quite easy to type, 'za' and 'fi' are still hard to type, so optimization might be needed. Also, since I use colons more than semicolons for Python, I'm considering swapping semicolons and colons, but otherwise, it's working well without issues.<br><br></p><h2 id="ha214098e44">Summary</h2><p>Eucalyn layout is amazing! If you have the basics of QWERTY but are dissatisfied, it's a layout worth pursuing for writing articles or programming purposes.</p>
