# Building a Speaker Using BS-8 and Fostex FE83NV2

I built a speaker using FOSTEX's FE83NV2 and the BS-8 enclosure.

## Background of the Project

I'm setting up a sub-system in my small workspace. I'm using a compact setup with FiiO K7, which combines a USB DAC and headphone amplifier, along with Topping's PA5 II power amplifier, to easily enjoy headphones like the Denon D9200. However, I couldn't find a speaker that matched the space in terms of size and convenience. I considered DALI's SPEKTOR1, but the exterior quality didn't quite fit, and I didn't want to go for the more expensive DALI MENUET series. Since the system is meant to be simple, I preferred something easy to drive, and a single-unit speaker seemed ideal.

Unfortunately, no commercial product met these demanding specifications at a satisfactory price, so I decided to build one myself. While researching enclosures, I learned that BS-8, designed by Tetsuo Nagaoka, is famous for its compact size and simplicity. Many people have built it, and I found stores on BASE selling the enclosure. With dimensions of H: 176mm, W: 130mm, D: 141mm, it's smaller than the DALI MENUET and features a single unit, plus the natural texture of the laminated wood appealed to me. So, I purchased the enclosure from [KONOCO](https://store.konoco-f.com) and decided to attach Fostex's 8cm full-range unit, which is known to pair well with BS-8.

The enclosure arrived pre-assembled, and combined with the unit, I built the speaker for around 20,000 yen.

## Assembly

The enclosure comes fully assembled. The baffle board has an opening diameter of φ73mm, and I only customized it by replacing the internal cable with BELDEN8470. I considered changing the back panel material to laminated wood but decided to prioritize functionality and kept it as MDF, since the back isn't visible daily. Assembly was straightforward—just soldering the internal wires directly to the speaker unit. I used SN-100C solder.

SN100C solder has a somewhat flashy sound quality with a wide high-frequency range and deep lows. Since the full-range unit doesn't have an extremely wide range overall, and reviews mentioned smooth and thick midrange, I chose SN100C even though I hadn't heard it before. The Senju Metal Sparkle Solder series would also work fine for a safe option. If you don't have solder on hand and want something easy to use, that's a good choice too.

After soldering, I simply tightened the unit with the included screws, and the speaker was complete.

## Review

The setup is as follows:

| Equipment | Name |
|----------|------|
| Player | iPad mini + Amazon Music (using AirPlay) |
| Transporter | Raspberry Pi3 + moOde Audio |
| DAC | FiiO K7 |
| RCA Cable | Belden 88760 |
| Amplifier | Topping PA5 II |
| Cable | Zu Audio Mission |
| Speaker | Custom-built speaker |
| Wall Outlet | FURUTECH GTX-D NCF(R) |

This is almost the same as before, except the speaker is now custom-built. I've also changed the USB for the USB-DAC to use iDefender+ and iPower for external power supply. Switching to a high-quality external power source often improves the resolution of USB-DACs, so I recommend it (you can even use a mobile battery for power, though it needs charging, and it performs well in terms of sound quality).

What stands out is the smoothness and thickness of the midrange. It's silky, without any dips, and vocals feel close, making it enjoyable to listen to. There's no muddy feeling even with the closeness, so classical or jazz sounds elegant and soft, with instruments resonating beautifully. Because it's a full-range unit, the sound connection is natural, allowing you to enjoy a thick sound. Plus, as a single-unit design, it's easy to drive with a modest amplifier, so you can get good results without spending much. The bass isn't overwhelmingly deep due to the small size, but it's not completely absent—it's naturally emitted from the front bass reflex port, with some weight without being thin, making it great for casual listening. The balance is good overall. The highs have a somewhat narrow range, so electronic music, metal, or sparkling genres might feel lacking, but it doesn't cause fatigue. While the range is narrow at both ends, the thick midrange and ease of driving make it very compatible with jazz or classical. R&B works for relaxed listening, though the bass rhythm might feel a bit insufficient. For anime songs or metal, the highs could be lacking, but if you're focusing on the midrange or using it for background listening, it's usable as a sub-system and quite impressive.

## Summary

It's not perfect, but the thickness, smoothness, and groove of the midrange are noteworthy. It's suited for casual listening to any genre and offers a different charm from pure audio, letting you enjoy the resonance of sound.

When not playing music, it's very compact and blends in as decor. During the day, you can listen casually, and at night, drift off to relaxed music—it's great for easily incorporating music into daily life.

The entire setup costs around 100,000 yen, so it might be a good reference for those wanting to dip into audio without a big investment.
