# [Custom Keyboard] Choco60 Assembly and Usage Experience

<p>I was using the English version of HHKB for programming purposes, but seeking further comfort and reduced physical strain, I decided to build a custom keyboard. I was drawn to Choco60 because its layout is similar to the English version of HHKB, making it compact and easy to handle shortcuts.<br><br></p><h2 id="h466db8fad1">Reasons for Choosing Choco60 and Custom Keyboards</h2><p><br><br>As mentioned at the beginning, I was interested due to its layout being almost identical to the English version of HHKB, with a compact design that makes shortcuts easy to use. Additionally, since the keyboard is split in the center, it allows for open shoulders and a natural typing posture. Using a keyboard often leads to hunched shoulders and poor posture, but splitting the keyboard can help improve this, reducing issues like shoulder stiffness and back tension.<br><br>In February, I was involved in a traffic accident and have been attending a chiropractic clinic, but due to my job requiring extensive keyboard use, it's been pointed out that my hunched back might be contributing to the discomfort. Therefore, I chose a split keyboard. Moreover, with the current situation leading to prolonged WFH (work from home), I've had more opportunities to use keyboards, so I wanted one with my preferred key feel. I've used electrostatic keyboards like Realforce and HHKB for about 10 years, but I prefer the feel of mechanical switches, specifically something like Cherry's black switch. To explore heavier switches, I decided to build a custom keyboard.<br><br></p><h2 id="h59c0294b52">Materials</h2><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Materials</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Unit Price</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Quantity</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Total Amount</p></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Purchase Source</p></th></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">Choco60</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥15,400</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>1</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥15,400</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yushakobo</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">Sakurios Switch (5-pack)</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥708</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>13</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥9,204</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Yushakobo</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">DSA PBT Blank Keycaps (2-pack)</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥110</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>26</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥2,860</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>TALP KEYBOARD</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">DSA PBT Blank Keycap (1Piece/1.5U)</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥110</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>4</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥440</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>TALP KEYBOARD</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">DSA PBT Blank Keycap (1Piece/1.75U)</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥150</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>2</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥300</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>TALP KEYBOARD</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">DSA PBT Blank Keycap (1Piece/2.25U)</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥150</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>3</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥450</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>TALP KEYBOARD</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">DSA PBT Blank Keycap (1Piece/2.75U)</a></p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥150</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>1</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥150</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>TALP KEYBOARD</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>3.5mm 4-pole Plug (TRRS)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥80</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>2</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥160</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>ALI Express</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>PET Tube (Carbon)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥150</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>1</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥150</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Oyaide Electric</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Paracord (30m)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥1000</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>1</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥1,000</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>ALI Express</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>PTFE Cable (1m)</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥120</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>2</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>¥240</p></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Akihabara</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><br><br>　　<br><br><br></p><h2 id="h02344d1bc7">Assembly</h2><p><br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">Build Guide</a> was followed for assembly. Although I'm experienced with soldering, tasks like bending parts for soldering and making the TRRS cable, along with firmware flashing, took about 2 hours.<br><br>　　<br><br>I used pliers to bend the diode legs and then inserted them into the PCB board for soldering. Bending them by hand and threading them all at once before soldering in one go might save time, but due to my personality, I couldn't do it that way, and this part took the most time.<br><br><br>On the opposite side of the diodes, I attached the TRRS jack and reset button.<br><br><br>I installed the stabilizers. Note that the stabilizer on the right shift is oriented in the opposite direction, but that's correct.<br><br><br>I attached the acrylic board. I was afraid of cracking the acrylic by overtightening the screws, so I used a torque driver for this step.<br><br><br>I firmly inserted the switches over the acrylic board and soldered them. Make sure there are no assembly errors and that they are securely fitted to the PCB board before soldering, as fixing mistakes later can be very troublesome.<br><br>I forgot to take a photo, but I mounted the Pro Micro on the PCB. It seems you just need to solder a special pin header to the Pro Micro side and plug it into the PCB side. Since the soldering points on the Pro Micro might interfere with the acrylic board, make sure it's securely fitted and trim any protruding pins. I also applied a small amount of epoxy adhesive to reinforce the USB connector. Be careful not to let the adhesive flow into the USB jack.<br><br><br>I cut the wires into 50cm lengths each and made a 4-core TRRS cable. Paracord can be obtained cheaply from Amazon or AliExpress. After soldering the wires to the TRRS plug, I twisted them casually, passed them through the paracord outer covering, and then threaded the PET tube over that. Finally, I attached the remaining TRRS plug on the other end, and it's done.<br><br><br>I connected the two Choco60 units using the TRRS cable and connected them to the PC. Following the guide, I flashed the firmware, and it became usable.<br><br></p><h2 id="hde965b176a">Completion</h2><p>At first, I felt it was hard to type because I wasn't used to the split keyboard, but once I got accustomed to it, typing became easier and I could type in a natural posture. Subjectively, the Sakurios switches are very quiet, so I think they would be fine even if used in an office. At least, they're incomparable to HHKB; they don't make a light sound, but rather a calm, clacky feel.<br><br></p><blockquote><p>I thought Sakurios was quiet subjectively, but when I recorded it, there's a subtle sound. <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/86jS1wiTGW">pic.twitter.com/86jS1wiTGW</a></p><p>— K (@rmc_km) <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">July 6, 2020</a></p></blockquote><p><br><br><br><br>I'm not sure if it supports N-key rollover, but for typical tasks like writing documents or programming, most people should be able to use it without issues.<br><br></p><blockquote><p>I'm getting quite used to Choco60 + Sakurios!<br>High-end 10,000 yen course [Normal],<br>★14,840 yen saved!

The linear switches provide a smooth, stress-free press, which is different from Realforce or HHKB. Personally, I prefer the feel of mechanical linear switches.<br><br>That said, Realforce and HHKB are attractive for their durability and consistent performance over 10 years, so for the general public, I might recommend off-the-shelf products over custom ones. However, for those like me who aren't satisfied with that, custom keyboards offer powerful customization options, allowing you to choose the keyboard, switches, and keycaps yourself. It's not cheap, and it has some unique aspects compared to standard keyboards, but the appeal of creating a keyboard tailored to your needs is something you can't get from regular products—it's a fun world for those who want to go all out.<br><br>Once WFH ends, I'd like to build another keyboard for home use.<br><br></p><h2 id="h114ff50457">Eucalyn Layout</h2><p><br><br>With custom keyboards, you can even change the key layout itself, and I discovered an interesting layout on <a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">Yushakobo</a>. It's very easy for typing Japanese, and after verifying with 10,000 lines of Python code, it's efficient. I was able to learn touch typing in 15 minutes to 2 hours and increase my speed to 3.4 keys/sec in 17 days, so I'd like to introduce the details next time.<br><br><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3231669075263956300/768407266301972085?hl=ja#">[Link to Eucalyn Layout Discussion]</a><br><br></p><p></p>
